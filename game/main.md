## Platforming Game

**Project description:** This is an Adventure/Puzzle platforming game that I'm working on in my spare time.  The primary goal is to create a game that captures many of the gameplay elements I enjoyed growing up, yet combines them in a way that is novel and interesting.  The secondary goal is to make a game that is fun to play across multiple platforms, including mobile devices.

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
