<img src="img_sept.png?raw=true"/>

**Project description:** A 3-dimensional simulation of the upper airway. The Upper Respiratory Virtual Lab (URVL) was created to provide medical students with a view similar to what they would see if performing a rhinoscopy. Anatomical features are marked with targets, which can be tapped to access in-depth information.

URVL was created using Unity3D as an iPad, Mac, and PC app.  The iPad version can be found [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/upper-respiratory-virtual-lab/id435530624).
